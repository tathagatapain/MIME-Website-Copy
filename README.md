# Art Teas Tree Cafe

A modern artistic cafe website concept for **Art Teas Tree Cafe**, a Kolkata-based cafe associated with the **Mime Institute of Calcutta**.

This is not a luxury cafe brand. It is an emotionally warm, artistic, human space built around conversation, adda culture, books, tea, cigarettes, friendship, creativity, and slow social living.

## Project Philosophy

Art Teas Tree Cafe reimagines the familiar experience of hanging out at a roadside tea stall, or **cha er dokan**, and transforms it into a beautiful artistic social space with seating, books, ambience, curated snacks, and thoughtful beverages.

The heart of the cafe is simple:

> Human connection over digital isolation.

The website should feel like a rainy evening conversation over tea and cigarettes: warm, imperfect, textured, literary, and deeply human.

## Getting Started

Anyone cloning this repo on a fresh machine should be able to follow these steps and have the site running locally in about two minutes.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20 or newer** ([download](https://nodejs.org/)). Run `node --version` to check; if it prints `v20.x.x` or higher, you're set. Anything below 20 will fail to install Astro.
- **npm 10 or newer** ships with Node. Run `npm --version` to verify.
- **Git** ([download](https://git-scm.com/)). Only needed to clone the repo.

If you don't have Node, the cleanest install is via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (macOS / Linux) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows). Then:

```bash
nvm install 22
nvm use 22
```

### Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SohamDutta2001/Mine-Website.git
cd Mine-Website
npm install
```

`npm install` pulls Astro, React, Tailwind, the four `@fontsource` font packages, and the rest. First install is ~3 minutes; subsequent installs are seconds. Lockfile-aware (`package-lock.json`) so installs are deterministic across machines.

### Available scripts

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Starts the Astro dev server at [http://localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321). Hot reload on every save. |
| `npm run build` | Runs `astro check` (type + content schema validation) then builds the static site to `dist/`. This is what CI runs. |
| `npm run preview` | Serves the `dist/` folder so you can inspect the production build locally before deploying. |
| `npm run astro -- <cmd>` | Runs an arbitrary Astro CLI command (e.g. `npm run astro -- add mdx`). |

### First-run checklist

1. `npm install` — should finish with `added N packages`.
2. `npm run dev` — terminal should print `Local: http://localhost:4321/`.
3. Open that URL. You should see the Art Teas Tree Cafe homepage with placeholder gradient images, warm typography, and the navigation.
4. Click through `/experience`, `/menu`, `/adda`, `/visit`. Page transitions should fade smoothly.
5. `Ctrl+C` to stop the dev server. Run `npm run build` once to confirm the static build also succeeds.

### Adding your own photos

Drop real photos into the `photos/` folder, then edit `src/data/photos.ts` to import from the new file instead of the placeholder. Astro's `<Image>` component handles AVIF/WebP/responsive sizing automatically. See [photos/README.md](photos/README.md) for the full naming convention.

### Deploying

The site builds to a static `dist/` folder, so it deploys to any static host:

- **Vercel / Netlify:** connect the GitHub repo and accept defaults. They auto-detect Astro.
- **GitHub Pages / Cloudflare Pages:** point at the `dist/` folder, build command `npm run build`.
- **Any other host:** `npm run build`, then upload `dist/` contents to the web root.

### Troubleshooting

- **`npm install` fails on Windows with a sharp / native module error.** Make sure Node is 20 or newer. Older Node versions can't compile sharp.
- **`npm run build` complains about a missing photo.** You edited `src/data/photos.ts` to point at a file that doesn't exist in `photos/`. Either add the file or revert the import to a placeholder.
- **Fonts look wrong in dev but right in build (or vice versa).** Clear the Astro cache: delete the `.astro/` folder and re-run.
- **Port 4321 is taken.** Run `npm run dev -- --port 4322` (or any free port).

### Project documentation

- [docs/design.md](docs/design.md) — full design doc, locked architecture, and what's deliberately not in scope. Read this before making structural changes.
- [photos/README.md](photos/README.md) — naming convention for adding café photos.
- [photos/CREDITS.md](photos/CREDITS.md) — track attribution for every real photo that ships.

## Brand Identity

The cafe is inspired by:

- Kolkata adda culture
- Theatre, mime, and artistic expression
- Hand-crafted human touch
- Imperfection and warmth
- Nostalgia
- Intellectual socialisation
- Books, tea, smoke, and conversation
- Slow living and offline friendship

The experience should feel Bengali, artistic, intimate, intellectual, and conversational, not corporate or glossy.

## Target Audience

- College students
- Artists
- Theatre people
- Writers
- Readers
- Smokers
- Friend groups
- People seeking calm social spaces
- Intellectually curious young adults

## Website Mood

The website should feel:

- Warm
- Handcrafted
- Artistic
- Analog
- Intimate
- Literary
- Conversational
- Textured
- Emotionally human

Avoid:

- Corporate cafe aesthetics
- Overly polished startup design
- Sterile minimalism
- Glossy luxury branding

## Visual Direction

Use:

- Textured paper backgrounds
- Warm earthy tones
- Tea-brown palette
- Muted greens
- Sepia
- Charcoal black
- Handwritten typography accents
- Sketch illustrations
- Notebook and journal-inspired UI elements
- Subtle grain textures

The visual atmosphere should suggest:

> If Satyajit Ray designed a modern adda cafe website.

## Typography Direction

The website should mix:

- Elegant serif fonts
- Handwritten accent fonts
- Editorial magazine-style layouts

Typography should feel literary and expressive, with enough warmth and imperfection to avoid looking sterile.

## Website Sections

### 1. Hero Section

A large emotional landing section with:

- Artistic typography

- A poetic tagline
- CTA buttons

Possible tagline directions:

- Where conversations steep slowly.

- A tea stall, reimagined.

### 2. About Section

Create a beautifully designed menu experience using artistic cards or handwritten menu styling.

The imagery should feel documentary and candid rather than commercial, showing real warmth, texture, people, tables, books, cups, smoke, and conversation.

### 6. Book Corner Section

A dedicated section for:

- Bookshelves
- Reading corners
- Quiet moments
- Literary atmosphere

### 7. Community / Adda Section

## Technical Direction

Shipped build stack (revised from the original brief during eng review — see [docs/design.md](docs/design.md)):

- **Astro 4** with static export (ships HTML by default, React only where it earns its weight)
- **React 18** islands for the menu filter and gallery lightbox
- **Tailwind CSS 3** with a custom design-token palette
- **TypeScript** in strict mode
- **`@fontsource`** self-hosted woff2 fonts (Cormorant Garamond, Lora, Caveat, Hind Siliguri) — no Google Fonts CDN
- **Astro Content Collections** (Zod-validated) for the menu
- **Astro View Transitions** for the ink-fade page transitions — built-in, no Framer Motion

Implementation qualities delivered:

- Fully responsive, mobile-first
- Three of five pages ship zero JavaScript
- Auto-optimized images (AVIF / WebP / responsive srcset) via Astro `<Image>`
- Lazy-loaded images below the fold
- Editorial typography hierarchy, 4-size display scale
- Subtle ink-fade view transitions between pages
- Soft hover interactions (warm-amber underlines, polaroid tilt-on-rest)
- Warm earthy palette ready to be re-tuned once real café photos arrive

## Creative Note

The emotional atmosphere matters more than flashy UI.

This should not become a generic cafe website. It should feel rooted in Kolkata, adda, theatre, literature, tea, cigarettes, friendship, and the handmade beauty of imperfect human spaces.
